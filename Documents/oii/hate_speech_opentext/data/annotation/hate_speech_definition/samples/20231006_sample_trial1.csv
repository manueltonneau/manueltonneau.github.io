People have hated each other for centuries for different reasons.  People will always disagree. Shutting down the flow of free speech an conversation achieves nothing useful and actually creates further hate"
84,gbr,This is hard because I didn’t see any of the conversations as hate speech only people having different views. I do believe there is hate speech but hate speech for me would be along these ‘I hate people who live in xxxx they need to go back to where they came from’. That to me is hate speech.
85,gbr,"I don't recognise the concept of ""hate speech"" or ""offensive speech'. By classifying anything as ""hate speech"" we're limiting freedom of expression. Many of the remarks displayed in this questionnaire are in language that I wouldn't use even if I agree with them but whenever such language is used I ignore it and that's what all of us can do. Those who claim to be hurt by such remarks shouldn't be using social media."
