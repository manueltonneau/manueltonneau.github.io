In meinem kulturellen Umfeld ist zeitmeineslebens einer der drei als Mohr dargestellt. Drei weise Männer aus dem Morgenland besuchen das Jesuskind. Jetzt wird von den woken Medien behauptet, dass mit ""schwarz"" schwarze Haare gemeint warwn als Bedeutung für Mann mittleren Alters. Damit werden aus drei weisen Männern drei weiße Männer. Ich sehe also 3 weiße Figuren und frage den Werbetreibenden ""Wer von den dreien ist jetzt der Neger?"" und erhalte eine Sperre auf facebook,  weil facebook selbst fremdenfeindlich denkt und der Meinung ist, dass die Verwendung der Wortes Neger NUR Sklave bedeutet und die bezeichnete Person diskriminieren würde. Also: Stehen vier schwarze Männer an der Bar: ein Schornsteinfeger, ein Gothik, ein Priester und ein Neger. Bin ich jetzt fremdenfeindlich, weil ich Personen aufgrund äußerer Merkmale benenne? Ist ""Blondine"" dann auch Rassismus oder Fremdenfeindlichkeit? AKTUELL laufen für mich auf facebook weiter Sperren für die Frage  ""Darf der Neger nicht auch mal was tolles erfinden?"" (Fernseher ohne Stromanschluss)  und die Aussage ""Die Neger sind lustig."" (deutsche Satire über Kobaltabbau) sowie ""Die Russen sind böse. Das wusste schon Hitler."""
