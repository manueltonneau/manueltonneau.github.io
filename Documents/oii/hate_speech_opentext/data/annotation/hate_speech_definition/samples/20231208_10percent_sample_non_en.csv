O ile atakowanie grup jak chociażby geje czy czarni można uznać za mowę nienawiści, współcześnie przedstawiciele mniejszości są zbyt przewrażliwieni i uważają za atak niemal każdą formę wyrażania własnego zdana, która nie zgadza się z lewicowym podejściem. Przykładowo: uważam za negatywne zjawisko atakowanie fanów i wyzywanie ich od rasistów tylko dlatego, że ci są niezadowoleni, że Netflix adaptując ich ulubiony serial bądź książkę, przefarbował znaną postać na czarno. Blackwashing to forma rasizmu ze strony aktywistów i naturalnym jest negatywny odzew ze strony fanów, dla których materiał źródłowy ma znaczenie. Dlatego uważam, że media społecznościowe jak Twitter nie powinny usuwać postów osób o prawicowych poglądach, jak mają to w zwyczaju, zwłaszcza gdy serwis ten sprzyja kwitnięciu takich zjawisk jak Cancel Culture, które jest kwintesencją mowy nienawiści, jako że prowadzi do tego, że ludzie często tracą pracę przez nadinterpretację ich słów przez lewicowych aktywistów. Można więc stwierdzić, że 21 wiek ma problem z bardzo jednostronnym podejściem do tego, co jest mową nienawiści.","For me, hatred is an attack on a specific person, for example when we wish the death of the interlocutor or his family.While attacking groups such as gays or black can be considered as hate speech, today representatives of the minority are too oversensitive and consider it an attack of almost every form of expressing their own, which does not agree with the leftist approach.For example: I consider it a negative phenomenon to attack fans and challenge them from racists just because they are dissatisfied that Netflix, when adapting their favorite series or book, dyed the known character in black.Blackwashing is a form of racism on the part of activists and the negative response from fans for whom the source material matters is natural.That is why I think that social media like Twitter should not remove the posts of people with right -wing views, as they are in custom, especially when this service promotes the flowering of such phenomena as Cancel Culture, which is the quintessence of hate speech, as it leads to the fact that people oftenThey lose their work by overinterpretation of their words by leftist activists.It can therefore be said that the 21st century has a problem with a very unilateral approach to what is hate speech.","For me, hatred is an attack on a specific person, for example when we wish the death of the interlocutor or his family.While attacking groups such as gays or black can be considered as hate speech, today representatives of the minority are too oversensitive and consider it an attack of almost every form of expressing their own, which does not agree with the leftist approach.For example: I consider it a negative phenomenon to attack fans and challenge them from racists just because they are dissatisfied that Netflix, when adapting their favorite series or book, dyed the known character in black.Blackwashing is a form of racism on the part of activists and the negative response from fans for whom the source material matters is natural.That is why I think that social media like Twitter should not remove the posts of people with right -wing views, as they are in custom, especially when this service promotes the flowering of such phenomena as Cancel Culture, which is the quintessence of hate speech, as it leads to the fact that people oftenThey lose their work by overinterpretation of their words by leftist activists.It can therefore be said that the 21st century has a problem with a very unilateral approach to what is hate speech."

जब हम एक-दूसरे पर नाराज होते हैं तो शब्दों की मर्यादा टूट जाती है। लेकिन सही मायनों में अभद्र भाषा क्या है, इसे समझने के लिए हमें प्रकृति और संस्कृति के बीच का फर्क समझना होगा।

अक्सर जब भी लोग इसका सामना करते हैं तो उन्हें चेताया जाता है। फिर भी, ऐसे रिवाज तो हैं जिनमें आप देवता को अपशब्द कह सकते हैं। इसे निंदा-स्तुति कहा जाता है।

आप जितनी कडी निंदा करना चाहते हैं उतने घृणित शब्दों का प्रयोग करते हैं। इस अभ्यास का तार्किक उद्देश्य भाव-विरेचन है। अपने शरीर से नकारात्मक ऊर्जा को बाहर निकालना। ईश्वर इस तरह की निंदा स्वीकार कर लेते हैं। मनोवैज्ञानिक रूप से देखा जाए तो यह सुरक्षा वॉल्व है।","When we are angry at each other, the dignity of words is broken.But to understand what is the abusive language in the true sense, we have to understand the difference between nature and culture.
