Anything said in favour of what you represent is good speech and anything said against what you represent is bad speech. It is only natural for people to dislike bad speech. I don't think most of the bad speech is intended with malicious intent or hatred in the ""aggressor's"" heart. It is almost always impossible to distinguish whether something said comes from a source of hate so it would be unwise to even define a term that you can not fully distinguish amongst all types of bad speech. And that is what is happening today. A good joke may constitute a bad speech and to some it may feel like they're born of hate while to others, not so much. When in reality, it is almost always of neutral nature.","Our fore-fathers fought for the right to speak their minds freely so their opinions and political stands would be taken seriously by oppressive bodies. That is how they won freedom the rest of us enjoy today. It would be both a spit-on-the-face and a big joke (on us) if we started censoring speech disguised as ""hate speech"". Humans (adults) have an incredible quality to distinguish good from evil. We should use our instincts to decide what speech is good and what is bad. And it is our responsibility and our responsibility alone to decide what to do with the speech presented before us. Because that is all that we can control. It's acceptable to return bad speech with bad speech. But shunning speech because someone doesn't like it is anti-libertarian and a big hit on the fundamental right to express ourselves.
