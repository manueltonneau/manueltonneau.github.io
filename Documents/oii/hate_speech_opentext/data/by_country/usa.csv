Ideally, I think social media companies should err on the side of freedom.

To illustrate the difference between speech that is reasonable to ban from social media and speech that shouldn't be banned, consider the two statements (both of which I disagree with):
1. ""Homosexuals should be put to death.""
2. ""Marriage should be between one man and one woman.""
The first statement is deeply offensive. It advocates violence (even if it isn't legally considered a threat) towards a group of people and even many people who believe same-sex sexual activity is a sin would find it offensive.

""You're just a man, men are toxic idiots and shouldn't be allowed to speak about this topic!"" is essentially hate-speech and I'd hope it would be moderated out (possibly by social media platforms) unless it is a container explicitly for venting on this, that someone wouldn't accidentally stumble into without warning
""Men are all toxic and if I ever find you I'm going to kill you!"" is an active threat that should result in a ban and possibly police examination to see if it is a credible threat. 
""Men are all toxic and we should all get together next Tuesday, march up to the strip club, and hang them all!"" is a call to recruit others into domestic terrorism and should get police scrutiny (because if any demographic is threatened then either the government defends them or they defend themselves, but we cannot have a society that says you are neither allowed self-defense nor will we, as a society, defend you).

R_1r8linKuycyBEQb,1.0,100.0,"Speech is speech, simply personal expression. If someone holds offensive views, it is much easier to assess their likelihood to escalate to a harmful action if their internal honest views are visible. Red flag laws would be more effective if someone's posts show intent to commit future harmful acts. Many of the publicized mass school shootings could have been avoided if the shooter's violent statements were properly recognized as an opportunity to intervene with behavioral therapies before any such violence occurred. Removing or censoring such posts simply hides the problem festering out of view.

Similarly, many people who NEVER commit any form of violence often reach catharsis by simply being able to vent and get the internal steam out of their system. Suppressing their ability to vent is likely to exacerbate their negative emotion, and cause an escalation.

If one has in fact committed violence, the content they have posted serves to help identify temporary or long-term indicators of the individual's state of mind at the time of the act or leading up to the act, and should remain visible as aid to increasing law enforcement's ability to detect states of mind in the future, and assist judiciary personnel to arrive at meaningful sentencing parameters.... is it a simple crime of passion or premeditated?

Free speech is a blessing, and the internet should always have free speech. 
Almost every social media platform has a way to ""block"" someone; stopping them from harassing you/hating on you.

","I think the kinds of speech that should have legal repercussions on social media should be the same ones as do, in other contexts. Libel or slander or fraud or sedition are what they are, regardless of context.

But at the level of corporate enforcement? I want the same level of intervention that I’d expect, somewhere like a movie theater or shopping mall. If someone wants to take a reasonably courteous, factually grounded stance in opposition to mine, that’s fine; if I don’t like it, I can stay off their profile. But if someone’s screaming slurs out in the middle of the food court, I want them to be firmly and expeditiously removed. 

I don’t think that person needs to be arrested—unless they were, for example, making a serious effort to instigate violence—and I’m going to have a different kind and level of expectation in, say, a children’s bookstore, as opposed to a sex toy store or boxing match or bar. But I think it makes absolute sense to remove posts and users who aren’t in keeping with a given site’s stated purpose—and, I think that behavior suggestive that someone can’t do their job in appropriate and unbiased ways can and should be a reason to lose said job.

This definition purposefully or conveniently omits class and politics, so it is unclear whether an expressed hatred of billionaires, certain political parties, ideas, or conveyors of said ideas, are constituted in the realm of ""hate speech.""

Thus ""hate speech"" clearly refers to the former definition and is shorthand for a type of ""overt"" or unseemly bigotry / ""bullying"" / harassment, which of course is entirely defined by the purported victim and is validated by the platform in question.

This is a model that heavily favors the easily offended, the status quo, and the corporate interests pushing their clinically sanitized advertiser-friendly online spaces.  It is a way to preemptively counter problematic political speech under the guise of protecting people from bullies and trolls.  It's an ever-expanding dragnet of ""unacceptable"" speech, premised on the idea that people are too impressionable, fragile, and frankly stupid to not read something and immediately take it as gospel.

But thanks to your efforts, we might yet still build a world where social media algorithms and college-educated mods curate Truth on behalf of the rabble.

So ""hate speech"" is whatever you want it to be, go wild with it.","Again, this depends entirely on the platform and its purpose and even how you define ""social media.""  This reflects my entire frustration with this survey; the loaded questions / begging the question.   So many questions were like this, offering either false binaries, or worded in such a way as to prime the answer.

I assume we're talking about a platform like Facebook; and by ""not be allowed"" we mean ""under any circumstance,"" regardless whether the victim petitioned for justice.  In that case, the only kind of thing that shouldn't be allowed on social media are direct (ie: actionable, specific) calls to violence upon a particular person or people.  You shouldn't be able to publicly organize a murder / beating.

HOWEVER: There are absolutely cases in which it is not only appropriate but morally compulsive to ""break the law,"" and this depends entirely on what the law is being broken for.  That is why blanket statements such as this surveyed offered are more muddling than they are clarifying: they're providing an answer to a very specific imagined context rather than the general one it purports to seek.
