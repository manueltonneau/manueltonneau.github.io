Though hostility isn't defined in UK law I believe there are lines that can be crossed, like targeted harassment campaigns (stalking, obsessive online hounding etc.), an exhibited intense vitriol toward someone based on immutable characteristics and or personal/political/religious beliefs, along with seemingly credible threats of physical violence, murder or sexual assault (if accompanied with persistent malicious language) for said reasons. 

'Hate speech' should not be entirely defined by the perception of the complainant. There has to be a line of prevailing common sense above the subjective in order to serve the truth, not favour certain demographics deemed to be disadvantaged by whatever special interest group at any one time.

Some people get hurt upset and cry out hate speech when the speaker didn't even mean it like that .hate speech is to purposely say ""I think you should die/ go kill yourself "" because of different opinions .

Saying your opinion should be allowed.  But we aren't allowed to do this now . People should be taught how to listen to the opinion of others and how to debate accordingly. 

Colour , orientation,  birth location, whatever  that is not hate speech . That is poor education .
Also saying "" that white guy over by the van "" is acceptable yet ""that black guy bu the van"" isn't acceptable. 
So to me . Both are acceptable.  
If one group of people can say certain words , then we all can . If one group can cry racism or hate speech , then we'll all can .

( it's a bunch of videos with white people doing things that are thick and stupid ) a white person shared it because it was funny . The white person was told off by Facebook fir hate speech or whatever . But the link alone should be classed as racist as its literally just videos shaming white people.

Some of your previous questions were difficult to answer, because I don’t think this subject is so black-and-white; for example, the person saying that homosexuality should not be taught in school - I chose that their job should not affect their job (people with horrible opinions still need an income too), but if that person worked in an educational setting, as a public figure (e.g. politician), or in a position of authority - my answer would be different. 

Many other times when I said comments don’t need removal or blocking - it’s not because they’re not bad or harmful comments, it’s because these issues need discussion and censorship prevents that. If that person is silenced / hidden, they continue to hold those harmful beliefs & feel bitter, & this could fester into something more serious; however, discussing such things with others could help them find a different perspective. Most times hate is learned, which means it can also be unlearned — a great example of this is Christian Picciolini, who began his teenage years as the leader of America’s first neo-Nazi skinhead gang, but eventually saw the error of his ways & now speaks out against racism (he has some TED talks on YouTube if you’re interested).","I don’t think anyone should be bullied or harassed ever. However, I do believe - first & foremost - that the “victim” should take the first step in the reporting process. I don’t think it’s social medias job to read every single conversation to determine context and if something is abuse / bullying. Sometimes the things said between 2 very close friends can sound abusive, but are actually just an *in* joke; something that makes them both laugh — cultures may interpret these things differently; however, where I am from in the UK, sarcasm and humour of a darker nature is common between friends - we call it “banter” (your previous comment example about the 4x4 car is a good example - to some, it’s bullying; to others, it’s just 2 friends winding each other up about a new car one of them bought). Consequently, I think it’s up to the targeted person in question as to whether or not they personally find something offensive, and if they do, to take appropriate steps (e.g. block / report it); from there it’s the responsibility of the social media platform to deal with reports appropriately (e.g. temporary or permanent bans).

If it’s a public forum / group / page - again, the audience should be able to decide what is appropriate & report things which they consider offensive. However, in this case, I think a key words alert should also be the responsibility of the social media team to utilise, as a signal to check group discussions — to keep potential extremism and cultism under control (e.g. you don’t want people using your platform to plan terrorism or similar hate crimes). There will always be groups where certain harmful demographics congregate (e.g. nazis may congregate in a community against immigration), & these groups should be brought to the attention of police &/or other relevant authorities.",EN-GB,Female,20.0,minority,gbr,

I wouldn't count religion/religious identity in this, because beliefs can be changed. Race or sexuality aren't intrinsically to do with a particular set of beliefs. 
Much of the time, whether something constitutes hate speech is to some degree subjective. E.g is ""trans women are not women"" hate speech? Or a sincerely held and legitimate view? 
Hate speech is not necessarily incitement to violence. But incitement to violence is almost always hate speech. Incitement to violence must also be explicit to count. To use the same example  ""trans women are not women"" - does this incite violence against transwomen? Not explicitly. And if such a statement did count as incitement, then every public statement would be subject to the test of imagining whether some random psychopath would use it in their own twisted minds as a justification for violence. That's far too vague.","The government should legislate to limit the power of the social media companies to remove/regulate/ban on their platforms. Particularly banning. This is what protecting free speech means in the C21st. It should be ensured through legislation that social media companies use their ability to censor very sparingly, and deciding which instances of censorship are permissible should be guided by regulations which are created perhaps by an independent body whose members are appointed by MPs from across the house, like select committees are. But its remit should be very limited, as stipulated in the legislation. It needs some democratic element.
I think that upholding free speech cannot be left to unaccountable corporate entities. 

The law/police should not be involved in directly to regulating hate speech that does not incite violence, unless perhaps it involves blatant and universally-accepted terms of abuse like the N-worsd, p*ki, etc. Part of the reason for this is the subjective element in judging what constitutes hate speech, which I've already mentioned. 


There is also currently no evenhandedness in how content is moderated/censored. Social media companies allow things to be said about straight, cis, white, male people which they would instantly chastise if it were said about other groups. Consistency is important.
Social media companies should not be able to ban people from using their platforms. The internet and social media are essential parts of public life, and being banned from social media is an extreme infringement on a person's freedom of speech and their full social existence. Moreover, such a decision should not be left to unaccountable private entities. Libertarian ""but it's a private company"" arguments are very poor, and I don't think their proponents actually grasp the importance of the issue.
